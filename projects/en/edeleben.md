Website for the artisan company “Edel-Eben.” The focus was on creating an elegant, animated design combined with a fully dynamic Statamic “building block” system, which I found particularly exciting.

Implemented using the TALL Stack (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire), each page can be built from flexible components, with animations, color transitions, and other visual accents fully customizable.

The branding was developed by the great designer [Felix Rostig](https://felixrostig.design/).
