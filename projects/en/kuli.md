The "Kulinarische Schnitzeljagd" organizes regular "tours" to various venues, mostly limited to one city, where end customers can then get (food)samples for free.

Together with Dajo Eberlei, a complex analysis and full automation of work processes took place in a timespan of over three years. The implemented solutions now reduces the administrative work of the organizers to a minimum.

Accounts for users and companies, competitions, a Shopify integration and statistics for almost 10000 users were implemented with Laravel, a Laravel Nova backend and Vue.js in the frontend. Thoroughly tested with a CI/CD pipeline and a combination of unit, feature and browser tests.
