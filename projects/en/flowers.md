Member portal and growing social network focused on the community of the queer-friendly party organizer ‘Flowers and Bees.’ Developed using the TALL-Stack (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire).

Handling high email traffic due to time-sensitive ticket links, which are exclusively sent to members. Includes a ticket exchange and many other benefits for members. A forum and an integrated ticket shop are already in the planning phase.
