The project, funded by the Ministry for the Environment in North Rhine-Westphalia, is a full-fledged social network for the gastronomic industry.

Together with Dajo Eberlei, the project was developed with Laravel and a Vue.js frontend. Companies throughout Germany can present their offers here, network, write blog posts and find out about events.

The requirements analysis of the project was just as exciting as the implementation and the subsequent successful transfer to the support phase.
