Relaunch of my own website, the Gatsby version from 2020 was a bit outdated and difficult to maintain.

The version you're looking at right now is developed using the really awesome Next.js framework on a node server. The website is completely implemented with Typescript and also deserved some smaller features like an inline video player for projects, a search and a small info page for my blog.

I open sourced the code <a href="https://github.com/simonvomeyser/simonvomeyser.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at GitHub</a> to showcase the way I work.
