Simple "business card" website for Lehrke air conditioning technology. The cool (hehe) concept comes from the professionals at <a href="https://agentur.pink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pink Agency</a>.

The Laravel website uses Alpine.js and Livewire in the frontend for simple interactions, as only a few interactive elements such as a typical contact form or a simple image gallery were required.

For the administration I used the Statamic CMS to enable flexible content management and to keep the website, which can be nicely divided into components", dynamic.
