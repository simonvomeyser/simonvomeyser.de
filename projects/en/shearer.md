Great project for the modern, gender-neutral hair salon "SHEARER Creative Studio".

Implemented with React and Gatsby as a statically rendered page, with an creative screen design, images and animations and at the same time top results in terms of Lighthouse Score and SEO. Gatsby is still a great tool for static sites that need to be hosted without Node and serve a lot of images.

The great CD comes from Katharina Link, the screen design was developed together with Felix Rostig and Damian Brzostewicz.
