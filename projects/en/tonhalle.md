Development of the website for the famous concert hall "Tonhalle" in Düsseldorf as SPA with Next.js and TypeScript.

The great agency <a href="https://bitmade.de">Bitmade</a> was trusted with the technical implementation and oversaw me with the frontend development. We developed with React Storybook and frequent code reviews, the backend was implemented by Bitmade as a Headless CMS with Drupal.

The app integrates a lot of services like Cloudinary for image optimization, Secutix for their ticketshop and is hosted on AWS.
