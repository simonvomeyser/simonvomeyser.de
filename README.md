My personal website
</h1>

Relaunch of my own website, the [Gatsby version from 2020](https://github.com/simonvomeyser/simonvomeyser.de-2020) was a bit outdated and difficult to maintain.

The version you're looking at right now is developed using the really awesome Next.js framework on a node server. The website is completely implemented with Typescript and also deserved some smaller features like an inline video player for projects, a search and a small info page for my blog.

## Installation
 
To install this page clone the repository first.
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:simonvomeyser/simonvomeyser.de.git
```

Next, you need to install the NPM dependencies.
``` bash
npm install
```

And finally, we need to kickstart your development
``` bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can replace my profile photo with a photo of Nicolas Cage. Feel free to send me a Pull Request ðŸ˜€
