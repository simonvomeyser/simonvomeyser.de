I have been planning and developing web applications for over <strong>10 years</strong>, hold a <strong>Master's degree</strong> in Media Informatics, and I am experienced as a team and <strong>project lead</strong>.
<br><br>
Since I always find these texts a bit impersonal, feel free to get to know me a little better:

  aboutMeReadMoreHeading1: '<h2>A little story about me! </h2>',
  aboutMeReadMoreText1: `
<p>
  My professional journey began with creating MySpace pages for metal bands, whose lyrics were just as hard to understand as their hairstyles.
</p>
<p>
  In early 2018, I completed my <strong>Master's degree in Media Informatics</strong> at the <a href='https://hs-duesseldorf.de/'>Hochschule Düsseldorf</a> with a grade of 1.4. During later semesters, I also had the opportunity to work as a tutor there.
</p>
<p>
  Parallel to my studies, I started working at <a href='https:/dekra-media.de/'>Dekra Media GmbH</a> as a web developer. After completing my master's degree, I became the <strong>team lead</strong> and main <strong>project manager</strong> of the eight-member web development team.
</p>
<p>
  Under my leadership, we developed the training platform <a href='https://dekra-safety-web.eu'>DEKRA Safety Web</a> as a test-driven Laravel/Vue application. Over the three years of development, we overcame many enterprise-level challenges such as multi-tenancy, integrating customer APIs, and white-labeling — serving 250 clients, partners, and around a quarter-million users.

  aboutMeReadMoreHeading2: '<h2>And nowadays?</h2>',

<p>
  In early 2021, I decided to work as a <strong>full-time freelancer</strong>. 
  I plan and develop large web projects, often collaborating with other freelancers or agencies in team settings.
</p>
<p>
  Some of my highlights include the implementation of the project <a href='https://muellnichtrum.rlp.de/' target='_blank'>Müll nicht rum</a> for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and the website relaunch of the esteemed concert hall <a href='https://www.tonhalle.de/' target='_blank'>Tonhalle Düsseldorf</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I have also been involved in other exciting projects, which I am unfortunately unable to disclose in detail. One example is the automation of advertising media for a large German retail company with <strong>Next.js</strong>, as well as the relaunch of a publishing platform for a major publisher with <strong>Laravel/Statamic</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  For me, communication and requirements analysis are more important than any technology, but technically, I prefer working with <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Vue.js</strong>. <br>
  As a big fan of <strong>agile methodologies</strong>, I have been <strong>Scrum certified</strong> since 2022.
</p>
<p>
  Now that you've read all this, it's your turn! I look forward to getting to know you or your team and working together on exciting projects! Feel free to send me a "Hallo, guten Tag!" (as we say in Germany)

    <p>You will find a few of projects I was involved in here. I prefer working with <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>. </p>
    <p>Most projects are way more interesting than the space here allows for. 
    Requirements engineering and communication is crucial for a successful product - even before the first line of code is ever written.</p>
