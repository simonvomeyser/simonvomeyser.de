    To be a little more precise: I am your partner in planing and developing web projects. <br><br>
    As a fullstack developer, I am specialized in Javascript Frontend Frameworks (Vue.js, React.js) and Laravel. <br> <br>
    As a project manager, I use agile development techniques (Scrum, Kanban) ... and a lot of coffee ☕️.

  aboutMeReadMoreHeading1: '<h2>A little story about me! </h2>',
  aboutMeReadMoreText1: `
    <p>
      I've been working as web developer for over <strong>10 years</strong> – and I love what I do. 
    </p>
    <p>
     My journey began by creating MySpace pages for metal bands whose lyrics were as hard to understand as their haircuts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished my master's degree in Media Computer Science in <a href='https://hs-duesseldorf.de/'>Düsseldorf</a> early 2018 with a final grade of 1.4 (about a 	3.6 GPA, A-). I also taught students there as a tutor... trying to be the least confused person in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started working for the company <a href='https://dekra-media.de/' target='_blank'>DEKRA Media Gmbh</a> as a Web-developer while a was still studying and joined after my master’s degree as a <strong>Project Manger</strong> and <strong>Teamleader</strong> of the eight-person web team. <br>
      I am especially proud of the successful relaunch of the company’s big SaaS product <a href='https://dekra-safety-web.eu/' target='_blank'>Dekra Safety Web</a> - moving from a Typo3 to a modern, test-driven multi-tenant Laravel application with about a quarter of a million end-users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 2021 I decided to become a <strong>full-time freelancer</strong>. Since then I worked for a lot of projects with different clients, teams and agencies. 
      Big highlights were the project <a href='https://muellnichtrum.rlp.de/' target='_blank'>Müll nicht rum</a> for the Rhineland-Palatinate state government, and relaunching the website of the famous concert hall <a href='https://www.tonhalle.de/' target='_blank'>Tonhalle Düsseldorf</a>.
    </p>
  `,
  aboutMeReadMoreHeading2: '<h2>What I offer - and what not</h2>',
  aboutMeReadMoreText2: `
    <p>
      I offer consulting, project management and web development. I am comfortable working as part of a bigger team and in a team lead position.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work as a freelancer and am not looking for a full time job. Working together on a project for a certain timespan, and usually for 2-3 days in a week, is usually a good fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately I can't (and quite frankly shouldn't) offer any services outside my expertise, even if I am familiar with a few more technologies. I also can't offer help with design, branding or the implementation of small portfolio websites. I am well-connected though and can help you find professionals for these tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am your perfect partner in planning, management and the development of complex web projects. I help to launch startups or to optimize and automate your processes, make workflows more efficient and reduce costs.

     always happy to hear from you! :) <br>

    Requirements engineering and communication is crucial for a successful product - even before the first line of code is ever written.</p>
